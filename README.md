## ROH based kinship

The script is to compute ROH based kinship for all animals that have been haplotyped.  
The idea is based on the approach by [F. Gomez-Romano et al. (2016)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jbg.12213/epdf).  See the paper for the formulae.

### input data
       - Phased linkage file format with ID and Paternal and Maternal haplotypes for all SNPs
       - The marker map information
       -
